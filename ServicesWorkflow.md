# Payment Gateway Microservices Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the workflow between the various microservices in our payment gateway system.

## Services:

- **API Gateway**: Central entry and exit point for all external requests and responses.
- **User Service**: Manages user authentication, authorization and account details.
- **Card Management Service**: Responsible for securely handling and tokenizing card information.
- **Transaction Service**: Interfaces with external payment processors like Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, etc.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users after transactions or other significant events.
- **Security Service**: Ensures the secure handling of transactions, data protection, and fraud prevention.
- **Admin Service**: Provides admin functionalities, reporting, and dashboard views.

## Workflow:

### 1. User Interaction

- User logs into the application.
- Client sends the login request to the **API Gateway**.
- **API Gateway** routes the request to the **User Service**.
- On successful authentication, **User Service** returns a token.

### 2. Initiate Payment

- User fills out the payment form with their chosen payment method (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, PayPal).
- The client sends this data to the **API Gateway**.
  
### 3. Card Management

- If the payment involves card details, **API Gateway** forwards them to **Card Management Service**.
- **Card Management Service** tokenizes the card data, returning a token for transaction processing.

### 4. Transaction Processing

- **API Gateway** routes the payment request, including the card token (if applicable), to the **Transaction Service**.
- **Transaction Service** communicates with the chosen payment processor (e.g., Visa, PayPal) to process the payment.
- The status of the transaction (success, failure, pending) is recorded and sent back through the **API Gateway** to the client.

### 5. Notifications

- After processing, **Transaction Service** publishes a `transaction_completed` event.
- **Notification Service** picks up this event and sends an email/SMS to the user based on user preferences.

### 6. Security Monitoring

- **Security Service** monitors transactions for anomalies or potentially fraudulent patterns.
- Suspicious activities are flagged or halted for further review.

### 7. Admin Overview

- **Admin Service** accesses transaction data and other relevant metrics for reporting and dashboard functionality.

## Communication

- **Direct Calls**: Synchronous operations are handled through direct API calls between services.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous operations leverage an event-driven architecture, allowing services to publish and subscribe to events.
